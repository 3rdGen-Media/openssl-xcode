== openssl-xcode ==

This is an XCode project skeleton structure that can be used to build a static 
libcrypto.a library for use in Mac and iPhone projects. 

It is specifically intended for use in building secure iPhone 
applications alongside SQLCipher (http://www.zetetic.net/software/sqlcipher).

openssl-xcode was developed by Stephen Lombardo at Zetetic LLC.

[ Usage ]

In a normal case you would use it thusly:

1. download the OpenSSL source code directly from
   http://www.openssl.org/source/ 
2. Tar an unzip the archive and move it to your desired build location
3. Clone the openssl-xcode git repo to make a local copy
4. Copy or move openssl.xcodeproj into the OpenSSL source directory
5. Open openssl.xcodeproj in xcode and initiate a build

This project actually relies on the OpenSSL configure and make
system to build the libraries. However, it does attemt to automatically
detect and use the appropriate build settings for arch (i386/ppc/armv6),
build tools, and SDK directories. This makes it approprate for inclusion
as a project reference into an iPhone application project.
